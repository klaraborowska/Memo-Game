## How To Play
Flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

##### Each turn:
Click on a card to flip it and reveal its underlying symbol.
Turn over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
